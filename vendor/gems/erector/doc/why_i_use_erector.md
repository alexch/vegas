Here is a list of reasons of why I (Brian Takita) like using Erector for HTML files:

1. The library is 100% pure ruby
1. Encapsulation. e.g. Instance variables stay within an instance.
1. It is easy to refactor code with simple method extraction than it is to create rails helper methods.
1. I can create declarative widgets with classes or a more terse api (see the Table example).
1. My widgets can better express a domain language.
1. Extracted methods follow the same rules as normal ruby objects. Partial templates require passing in local variables or using global instance variables.
1. Inheritable layouts.
1. The issue of forgetting to close tags goes away.
1. Text is html escaped by default.
1. I prefer class and module based hierarchies than template-based hierarchies.
