But views want to do codey things like loops and variables and modular decomposition and inheritance, and every effort to wedge control logic into markup ends up smelling like a hack. There's always going to be some algorithmic idiom that's awkward in a template language. We figure, why deny it? Code is code. Embrace your true nature! Lick your screen and taste the code!"
