== 0.6.3 / 2009-05-06
* Major update to API. You *will* have to change your code. There are deprecation warnings/errors
and there should be an upgrade guide up on the website soon.
* 'render' renamed to 'content'
* widget constructor only takes one parameter, an 'assigns' hash (plus the optional default block)
* to render one widget from inside another, use the 'widget' method (not 'render_to'). This method 
accepts either a widget instance, or a widget class and an assigns hash.
* 'needs' macro to declare the variables your widget accepts via the 'assigns' constructor parameter
* Removed Widget#to_s caching, which fixed indentation issues.
* BUGFIX: Indentation level is now correctly propagated to nested widgets.
* Erector's Rails support strategy has changed. The released version of Erector only supports the latest stable
Rails version (currently 2.3.2). If you need support for earlier versions of Rails, there are separate
Git branches for each one, but we will not be in the habit of keeping these up to date with the latest
features and patches.
* Renamed the command line tool to 'erector'

== 0.5.1
* Added methods to easily render additional HTML elements (col,
object, and about a dozen others).  There are now methods for all 
non-deprecated elements from the HTML 4.0.1 spec.  As before, if 
erector doesn't have a method built-in, you can still call the element 
or empty_element method to output any tag.
* The method instruct!, which was a deprecated synonym for instruct,
has been removed.
* Fixed bug in resolving view files for pluralized controllers

=== 0.5.0 / 2008-12-13
* install_dependencies refreshes the rails_versions directory
* Widget takes a string instead of an IO object to be more compatible with Rails.
* Removed Doc
* Widget writes directly to output string instead of to #doc

=== 0.4.200 / 2008-10-11
* Erector can now pretty-print the generated HTML to make it easier to read.
* Add join method to Erector::Widget.

=== 0.4.191 / 2008-07-29
* Renamed HtmlParts to Doc
* Widget#doc is now a HtmlParts which proxies to the passed in IO stream
* Better compatibility with standard Rails rendering because ActionController::Base#render and #render_widget now have the Widget write directly to _erbout.
* ActionView::Base objects run with Erector now receive all of the instance variables
* Erector works with erb layouts
* Deprecate fake_erbout
* Better handling for file with .html.rb extension.
* Fix overwriting issue when using Rails helpers
* New method Widget#character
* Widget#nbsp without arguments now outputs a single non-breaking space.

=== 0.3.110 / 2008-05-29

* support capture from rails helpers, allowing form_for/form_tag to work right
* fix bug in view_paths support (finding views was hosed)

=== 0.3.105 / 2008-05-29

* Lots of changes to support Rails integration better.
* Add partial support for render :partial.
* More Rails helpers proxies added to helpers.rb.
* Fake erbouts can now nest, allowing better support for Rails helpers like form_for (though they're currently capped at 10 deep to head off infinite regress).
* Rails finds both .rb and .html.rb files inside the app/views directories.
* Use Rails view_paths instead of hardcoded RAILS_ROOT/app/views (patch by Rami Grossman)
* add 'url' and 'css' convenience methods to Widget

=== 0.2.83 / 2008-04-23

* "erect" supports command-line options
* "erect" now works backwards -- you can output static html from a widget.rb file
* The web site is generated from erector classes (still pretty minimal though)

=== 0.2.61 / 2008-04-18

* Improvements to "erect"
  * works on HTML attributes (including namespaced attributes and hyphenated attributes)
  * works on directories (recursively looking for .html and .html.erb and .rhtml files)
  * converts DOCTYPE nodes
  * deals with HTML entities inside text and attributes

=== 0.2.54 / 2008-04-15

* New script "erect" to convert (some) .html.erb files into erector classes.

=== 0.2.42 / 2008-04-11

* Rails Controller now can render Erector widgets using #render
* Erector views can live inside Rails "app/views" directory, just like other views

=== 0.1.25 / 2008-02-26

* nbsp method
* :class => ['one', 'two']  (that is, passing an array rather than a string)
... perhaps one or two I forgot.
* rename tag to element
* add empty_element feature
* for the built-in HTML tags, knows which ones should be empty and which shouldn't be.
  For example, generates `<input />` rather than `<input></input>`
* text and attributes are quoted by default; call raw to avoid this
* h is rarely necessary now, but it returns a string rather than appending to the buffer
* nbsp method turns spaces into non-breaking spaces
* sending in an array for attribute values (typically CSS classes) concatenates them separated by spaces
* The column definition name can be a Proc that gets executed.
* Renamed instruct! to instruct (old one remains as a deprecated method for now), as it is no more side-effecting (or dangerous or whatever) than any other method in Widget.

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-02-13

* First public release

=== 0.0.1

* Was on pivotalrb.rubyforge.org
