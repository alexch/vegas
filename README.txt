What is Rails?

*  routes
*  views (ERB, HAML, etc)
*  databases
  * migrations
*  scaffolding
*  plugins
*  loadpath munging
  *  automatic class loading and reloading
* active_support helpers

What is Vegas?

* Sinatra
* Erector
* ActiveRecord
* no scaffolds, 
  *    don't miss em
  *    wouldn't it be nice if we had activescaffold type components for Erector
*  gems
  *    why isn't every plugin a gem?
* req
  * run.rb (rake run)

Everything else is just code.

This is a template with some rake tasks and user auth.
